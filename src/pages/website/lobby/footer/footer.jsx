              CPA SYSTEM: THE BEST VALUE-PER-MONEY INFLUENCER STRATEGY
            </h2>
            <p >
              Cost-Per-Action is a digital advertising payment model that allows
              to
              <strong
              >
                pay an influencer only for a specified action
              </strong>
              taken by a prospective customer.
            </p>
            <p >
              All actions covered by the model are directly related to some type
              of conversion, ranging from a newsletter sign up to a link click
              or sale, and many more, all determined by the advertiser/brand.
            </p>
            <p >
              Costs can be different depending on different factors, such as the
              complexity of the task, the urgency of the customer's need, or
              even the level of expertise required, but the advantage is that
              the advertiser will only pay for actions effectively processed and
              not only for number of posts or stories that maybe do not convert.

              Advantages of applying the CPA system to influencer marketing
            </h3>
            <p >
              CPA is a relatively new concept in digital advertising, but its
              appeal is clear: it offers a number of advantages compared to
              other more traditional formats, including
            </p>
            <ul >
              <li >
                increased efficienciy,
              </li>
              <li >
                greater scalability and flexibility,
              </li>
              <li >
                lower cost per impression.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p >
              In addition, CPA can help companies to better target their ads to
              specific segments of the potential customer base, offering a more
              comprehensive approach to marketing.
            </p>
            <p >
              DRIM has applied the CPA philosophy into the influencer marketing
              niche and that is driving a big impact for our brands and better
              profit for the influencers working for them.

                If you're looking for a big reach,
              </strong>
              you'll want to choose an influencer with a large mass audience.
              They'll be able to reach a wide range of people and help boost
              brand awareness.

                On the other hand, if you're focused on a niche and specific
                market,
              </strong>
              you'll probably need to find an influencer who has a smaller but
              concrete following. This means that they'll be able to focus their
              attention on a particular niche audience, producing relevant
              content that'll resonate with the people you want to reach.
